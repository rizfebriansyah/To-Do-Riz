# ToDoRiz

The main objective is for users to complete their tasks and receive rewards for their productivity. With a greater emphasis on mental health, wellbeing, and work-life balance, I would like to create the app To-Do Riz to help users form new habits and accomplish bigger goals.

To run the application:
1) Using terminal, cd to respective folder
2) Yarn install
3) Expo start
